Air communication is commonly thought as the most <b>safe</b> transport type. Because <b>passenger</b> <b>safety</b> is the main priority of all subjects engaged in air transport, technical, <b>organization,</b> procedure <b>barriers</b> <b>are</b> established in <b>order</b> to avoid <b>air</b> accidents. Some- times these facilities <b>fail;</b> <b>in</b> most cases because of human error. To learn lessons from these <b>failures,</b> accidents <b>are</b> investigated <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> their <b>causes.</b> <b>Such</b> investiga- tion <b>is</b> usually qualitative [8]. <b>In</b> the paper, a quantitative <b>analysis</b> of serious incidents is proposed. <b>The</b> "serious <b>incident"</b> <b>is</b> usually a very <b>dangerous</b> event <b>when</b> some <b>barriers</b> against <b>accident</b> <b>have</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> meet <b>their</b> <b>goal.</b> They <b>are</b> <b>very</b> important sources of knowledge <b>about</b> safety assurance systems in air <b>transport.</b> We want to <b>estimate</b> the <b>probability</b> <b>that</b> a <b>given</b> incident would transform into <b>accident.</b> With that <b>kind</b> of study at disposal, one can conclude whether <b>safety</b> facilities are sufficient or have to be extended. In order to evaluate <b>this</b> <b>probability,</b> <b>estimation</b> of <b>safety</b> barrier reliability has to be carried out. Unfortunately, in <b>most</b> cases <b>there</b> are no sufficient data to <b>infer</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> frequency of <b>events</b> for the <b>accident</b> scenario. <b>Unfortunately,</b> <b>it</b> is highly unlikely to find that data. There are two <b>reasons</b> of such situation. First <b>is</b> <b>that</b> some of <b>these</b> events <b>occur</b> very <b>rarely,</b> and additionally, <b>in</b> past <b>the</b> events without significant con- sequences were <b>not</b> usually recorded. The <b>second</b> one is human factor with suchmeasures that are difficult to evaluate as different reactions probabilities <b>and</b> error <b>activity</b> <b>probability.</b> Such measures are charged with <b>uncertainty</b> <b>and</b> subjective <b>esti-</b> mations. Only <b>methods</b> to obtain such knowledge are <b>expert</b> estimates. <b>These</b> <b>estima-</b> tions are not precise <b>and</b> not <b>sufficient</b> to probabilistic <b>analysis.</b> <b>In</b> safety, reliability, <b>and</b> risk <b>analysis</b> <b>and</b> <b>management,</b> information often is <b>uncer-</b> tain and imprecise. In book [10] <b>three</b> approaches to reliability and safety <b>with</b> uncer- tain and <b>imprecise</b> <b>information</b> are <b>presented:</b> probability and <b>statistics,</b> fuzzy set <b>theory,</b> <b>possibility</b> theory (inspired <b>by</b> the <b>above).</b> In <b>paper</b> [1] <b>the</b> <b>following</b> approaches for representation <b>of</b> uncertainty <b>are</b> listed: probability, <b>imprecise</b> (interval) probability, <b>probability</b> <b>bound</b> analysis, possibility theory (foundations: probability, statistics, fuzzy sets), Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. <b>The</b> <b>approach</b> to air <b>incident</b> analysis presented <b>in</b> our paper <b>is</b> inspired by the pos- sibility <b>theory.</b> In air incident analysis both types of components <b>have</b> to be <b>included:</b> static and dynamic. Static analysis can be executed by <b>means</b> of fault <b>trees</b> <b>with</b> fuzzy <b>probabili-</b> ties [16, <b>17]</b> and event trees <b>with</b> <b>fuzzy</b> probabilities <b>[7].</b> <b>Fuzzy</b> probability is <b>called</b> possibility. The <b>Dynamic</b> analysis is executed <b>in</b> the <b>time</b> domain. More precisely, <b>the</b> analysis may <b>be</b> carried out using minimal and maximal values of time <b>parameters</b> <b>similarly</b> to the safety study of some <b>railroad</b> crossing <b>in</b> [9]. The other approach is probabilistic when <b>time</b> <b>parameters</b> are represented by probability distributions as in [2] where time <b>coordination</b> of distance protections in high voltage power transmis- <b>sion</b> line was considered. <b>The</b> next kind of analysis will be based upon fuzzy <b>set</b> and will <b>become</b> the topic of the paper. In this <b>paper,</b> the serious incident which occurred at the Chopin airport in Warsaw in 2007 year <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>analyzed.</b> Only static analysis will be executed, while <b>dynamic</b> one will be the <b>topic</b> of the following paper. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> to find <b>the</b> probability that <b>given</b> incident would <b>transform</b> into accident, <b>the</b> analysis of event <b>trees</b> by <b>fuzzy</b> probabili- <b>ties</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> performed. An <b>analysis</b> of incidents using fuzzy <b>inference</b> <b>is</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>with</b> the <b>example</b> of a serious air traffic incident <b>which</b> <b>occurred</b> in <b>August</b> 2007 at the <b>Warsaw</b> Chopin air- <b>port</b> between Boeing <b>767</b> and Boeing 737 <b>aircraft.</b> <b>Its</b> <b>cause</b> was <b>classified</b> as a "hu- <b>man</b> factor" and the <b>causal</b> <b>group</b> H4 <b>–</b> "procedural <b>errors"</b> [18]. In the incident on <b>13th</b> <b>of</b> <b>August</b> 2007 <b>participated</b> two aircraft – Boeing 737 <b>(B737)</b> and the Boeing 767 (B767), which <b>more</b> or less at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time <b>were</b> scheduled for take-off from the Warsaw Chopin airport. As <b>the</b> <b>first,</b> clearance <b>for</b> <b>line-up</b> and wait on <b>runway</b> <b>29</b> was issued <b>to</b> B737. As a second, <b>clearance</b> for <b>line-up</b> and wait on runway <b>33</b> was <b>given</b> to the B767 crew. The <b>latter</b> <b>aircraft</b> was <b>the</b> first <b>to</b> obtain per- mission <b>to</b> <b>take-off.</b> A <b>moment</b> after confirmation of permission <b>to</b> take-off, both air- crafts began the start procedure at the <b>same</b> <b>time.</b> <b>The</b> B737 crew wrongly assumedthat <b>the</b> <b>start</b> permission was addressed to them. They probably thought <b>that</b> since <b>they</b> had received the permission <b>to</b> line <b>up</b> <b>the</b> runway first, they would be <b>also</b> the first to be <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> start. In addition, the categories of wake turbulence caused that from the traffic <b>efficiency</b> point <b>of</b> view, <b>it</b> would be <b>better</b> <b>to</b> start B737 <b>before</b> B767. <b>De-</b> cision of the controller, however, <b>was</b> different. The air traffic controller <b>(ATC)</b> <b>did</b> not watch the planes taking-off, <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time he was busy agreeing <b>a</b> <b>helicopter</b> take-off. The situation of <b>simultaneous</b> start was, nevertheless, observed by the pilot of ATR 72, who was <b>waiting</b> in the queue for <b>departure.</b> He reacted over the radio. After this message, <b>B767</b> <b>pilot</b> looked <b>right</b> and saw B737 taking-off. Then, on his own <b>initiative,</b> braked off and began <b>a</b> rapid deceleration, which led <b>to</b> <b>stopping</b> the plane 200 <b>meters</b> from <b>the</b> intersection of the runways. The assistant controller heard <b>the</b> ATR 72 <b>pilot</b> radio message <b>and</b> informed the controller <b>that</b> <b>B737</b> operated with- out authorization. The controller, who <b>originally</b> did not hear <b>the</b> information on <b>the</b> <b>radio,</b> after <b>16</b> seconds from the start, recognized the <b>situation</b> and strongly ordered B737 <b>to</b> discontinue <b>the</b> take-off procedure. <b>The</b> B737 crew performed braking and stopped 200 <b>m</b> <b>from</b> the intersection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> runways. In <b>the</b> <b>presented</b> example it can be <b>noticed</b> that <b>it</b> is sufficient to impose only one addi- tional risk factor (or <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> factors), and the incident would become, in <b>fact,</b> an accident. <b>There</b> are several premises <b>conducive</b> for an accident <b>[15].</b> 1. <b>Weather</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>(visibility)</b> are so <b>bad</b> that it is impossible to see the actual traf- fic situation. This applies <b>to</b> B767, ATR 72 crews, and the air <b>traffic</b> controller. 2. ATR <b>72</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>does</b> not <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> on <b>the</b> <b>runways,</b> just waiting for permis- <b>sion</b> to line-up the runway. <b>3.</b> ATR 72 pilot observes the situation, but <b>does</b> <b>not</b> immediately inform about <b>it</b> on the radio, instead <b>he</b> discusses it <b>with</b> <b>other</b> members <b>of</b> his own <b>crew.</b> 4. B767 crew, busy with their own take-off procedure, <b>does</b> not pay attention to <b>the</b> <b>message</b> transmitted over the <b>radio</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ATR <b>72</b> pilot. 5. B767 <b>crew</b> takes <b>a</b> wrong <b>decision</b> to <b>continue</b> the take-off, despite <b>noting</b> B737 aircraft. <b>Such</b> <b>decision</b> <b>could</b> arise, for example, with this reasoning: <b>"there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> possibility to stop before <b>the</b> intersection, let B737 <b>stop</b> - <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> <b>we</b> have a <b>per-</b> mission to <b>start,</b> maybe we can pass <b>the</b> intersection before the <b>B737",</b> <b>etc.</b> <b>6.</b> Assistant controller does not pay <b>attention</b> to the information given by <b>radio</b> <b>by</b> the <b>ATR</b> 72 pilot, <b>or</b> <b>does</b> not respond <b>to</b> it <b>properly</b> - <b>does</b> not inform the <b>controller.</b> 7. B737 crew does <b>not</b> <b>react</b> properly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> traffic controller command and does not interrupt <b>the</b> take-off procedure.
