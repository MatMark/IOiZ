In safety, reliability as well as risk analysis and management, infor-
mation often is uncertain and imprecise. The approach to air incident analysis
under uncertain and imprecise information presented in our paper is inspired by
the possibility theory. Notably, in such analyses these are both: static and dy-
namic components that have to be included. As part of this work, static analysis
of a serious incident has been performed. In order to do this, probability scale
which is based on fuzzy set theory has been given. The scenarios of transforma-
tion of incident into accident have been found and their fuzzy probabilities have
been calculated. Finally, it has been shown that elimination of one of premises
for transformation of the incident into accident significantly reduces the possi-
bility of this transformation.
